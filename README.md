A craft beer and brewery finder app.

This is my second version of Brew It, a craft beer and brewery finder app.
This app was inspired due to my curiosity on finding good craft beers, and trying new craft beers while traveling to new places and cities. 

With Brew It, there are two search fields.

The first search field allows you to search for your beer of choice, with the beer description information as well as which breweries carry them.

The second search field allows you to find breweries from your current location, so inputting your local address or cross streets will give local breweries near you.
You can also simply type in your brewery of choice, and find out the location, beers available, hours of operation, and contact information.

This app uses two APIS: the breweryDB API and the Google Maps API. 

This app is built with React.JS, Express.JS, Sass, etc.
